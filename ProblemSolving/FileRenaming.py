You have to find ways that after how many times character deletes from old file name we can get newFileName.
Both oldFileName and newFileName is given.
example :

for renameFile2 method
input = old - aaabbbccc
        new - abc
output - 27

for renameFile method
input = old - aaabbbccc
        new - abc
output - 0 (because only consecutive character deletion allowed)
